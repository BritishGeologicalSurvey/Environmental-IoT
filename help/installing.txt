# This works best if the host machine is linux or mac based
# As there are issues with using node.js on a windows file system (symbolic links/file path length)

# Install Virtualbox and Vagrant from:
https://www.virtualbox.org/
https://www.vagrantup.com/

# Clone Repo
git clone https://github.com/BritishGeologicalSurvey/Environmental-IoT

# Copy sensitive files not in repo
cp dbsecure.js Environmental-IoT/code/dbsecure.js
cp map-locations.js Environmental-IoT/code/public/js/components/map-locations.js

# Start Vagrant Machine
cd Environmental-IoT
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

# Now on vagrant vm
cd /vagrant/code
npm install

# Grab a Cuppa while dependancies are downloaded/compiled/installed!

# Start node
npm start

# Test on web browser on host machine
